# Stem Piano G - Manual Soldering

These instructions may be added in the future.

General comments:

* The manual soldering approach requires good soldering skills and probably a soldering microscope.

* All components on IPS were selected for manual soldering suitability. For example, no components are BGA.

* The analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) data acquisition subsystem is on a separate, removable, card (called the SCA) that connects to the IPS mainboard. This simplifies and reduces the cost of testing an ADC and enables experimenting with different hammer or damper ADC resolution and sampling rates. Also, ADC can be in packages that are difficult to manually solder. A separate circuit board lowers the cost and impact of soldering mistakes.
