# Tools for Building a Stem Piano

## Recommended

### Configuration Switch Tool
Thin wood or plastic utensil for moving the configuration switches.

### Digital Multimeter
Useful for checking power supply voltages, sensor (HPS) output voltage, pullup resistor voltage values, and other signals.

If using a version of HPS with a trimming resistor, the ohmmeter of a multimeter is useful for checking the final trimming resistance value.

An ohmmeter is also helpful to verify correct parts on boards.

### Small Breadboard 3.3 Volt Power Supply

Use for testing HPS sensors. These power supplies are small and inexpensive. Typically powered through a USB cable. Also need to purchase a breadboard for connecting the power supply. Instructions and pictures are provided in the [./hps_testing](./hps_testing.md) manual.

### Woodworking and Mechanics Tools

For building the frame, drilling sensor holes, mounting sensors, installing the hammer stop bar, etc.

## Optional

### 1.0mm Flat Head Screwdriver
Need if using a version of Hammer Position Sensor (HPS) with a trimming resistor. Use screwdriver to adjust the resistor.

### Soldering

If hand soldering any components, a complete soldering setup is needed.

### Oscilloscope

Use an oscilloscope to check time-varying signals. For example, the sampling rate and processor burden. For selecting oscilloscope bandwidth, the fastest circuit board signal is the SPI clock which can be up to 70MHz.
